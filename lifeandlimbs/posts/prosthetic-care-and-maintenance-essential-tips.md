### Prosthetic Care and Maintenance: Essential Tips

Proper care and maintenance of prosthetic limbs are crucial for comfort, durability, and optimal function. Whether you are a new user or have been using a prosthetic for years, following the right practices can prevent complications and improve daily mobility.

Cleanliness is key. Regularly wash the prosthetic socket and liner with mild soap and warm water to prevent bacterial buildup, skin irritation, and odors. Always ensure the device is fully dry before wearing it again.

Inspect your prosthetic for wear and tear. Check straps, sockets, and joints for cracks or looseness, and address issues promptly to avoid discomfort or injury. Lubricate movable parts if advised by your prosthetist to maintain smooth function.

Skin care is equally important. Monitor your residual limb for redness, sores, or swelling. Protective liners or socks can reduce friction and improve comfort.

Follow a regular maintenance schedule and attend follow-up appointments with your prosthetist. Learning proper donning, doffing, and adjustment techniques ensures safe and effective use.

With consistent care, prosthetic limbs remain functional and comfortable, empowering users to lead active, independent lives.
