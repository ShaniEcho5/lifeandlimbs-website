## Every step matters 
especially for those who once thought they’d never walk again. Life and Limb is a compassionate initiative dedicated to restoring mobility and dignity to individuals who have lost their limbs. Through advanced prosthetic solutions and community outreach, we aim to transform lives by turning challenges into opportunities.

In India, thousands of amputees face emotional, social, and financial barriers after limb loss. Many come from underprivileged backgrounds where access to quality prosthetic care is limited. Life and Limb bridges this gap by providing affordable, high-quality prosthetics, personalized rehabilitation, and continuous support.

Our mission goes beyond physical restoration — it’s about rebuilding confidence, independence, and self-worth. Every prosthetic limb we fit represents a story of courage, resilience, and renewed hope.

With a team of skilled professionals and generous partners, Life and Limb continues to make mobility possible for those who need it most. Together, we’re not just creating prosthetics — we’re rebuilding lives, one step at a time.
